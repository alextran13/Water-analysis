### Scenario

I came accross an interesting data of water quality. It includes chemicals and testing indexes that will be used to determine the quality of the water.

* pH: A quantitative measurement for acidity or basicity of a liquid form. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being most acidic and 14 most basic. pH is not regulated by EPA as pH is a aesthetic feature, therefore subjective to people. However I found a fun fact from a UCLA Health article that says Human blood is 7.4! (1) I attached a picture below so we can put pH under some perspectives for easier comparison.

* Hardness: Essentially is how high the mineral content in water is, the higher the content, the "harder" the water. Hardness has two categories: permanent and temporary hardness. Temporary hardness can be caused by Bicarbonates of Magnesium and Calcium. Some hardness can give moderate health benefits, others, however, can block oil pipeline leading to production loss. The range of hardness include soft, moderately hard, hard, and very hard.

  - Soft: 0 to 60 mg/L

  - Moderately hard: 61 to 120 mg/L

  - Hard: 121 to 180 mg/L

  - Very hard: > 180 mg/L


* Solids: (also as known as Total Dissolved Solids TDS) refers to the dissolved substances in water. These substances contain inorganic and organic matters that may cause harm for consumption. Typically solids presence cannot vaporize, instead can be physically removed by a filter. Since TDS is not a measurement of any single element or material, but a combination of them, TDS affects taste and odor of the water, and EPA doesn't regulate this index, however, has suggested the safest maximum for consumption is 500mg/L. (3)

* Chloramine: is a type of disinfectant used to treat water from bacteria in water pipeline
